<p>June 17, 2013 &#8212; 10:00-12:00<br/>
<strong>Hike from Monterosso to Vernazza</strong><br/>
This is a moderately strenuous hike that lasts from 2-3 hours (depending on how much time you spend taking pictures). It provides beautiful views or both Monterosso and Vernazza as you hike through the olive groves high above both towns. Bring your camera, water and comfortable shoes.<br/>
10am - Meet at the north end of the beach in Monterosso. Departure at 10:10.</p>

<hr />

<p>June 18, 2013 &#8212; 10:15-12:00<br/>
<strong>Lovers Walk</strong><br/>
This is a one-mile easy, paved walk along the famous Via Dell’Amore; a trail between the two southern most towns Riomaggiore and Manarola. It was created in the 1920s while making the way for the train line. Prior to this villagers from Riomaggiore and Manarola rarely married anyone from outside of their own town but this trail created a way for lovers from the two towns to meet in the middle and fall in love. Now it is a tradition to take a padlock with you and when you get to the half way point you and your lover write your initials on the padlock, attach it to the fence and throw the key into the water symbolizing that your love is sealed forever and can never be unlocked. To reenact this ritual Christopher will lead a group from Manarola at 11am and Anne will lead a group from Riomaggiore at 11am. We will meet in the middle and place our lock amongst the hundreds of others. You may join whichever group you like and everyone who wishes to is invited to bring a padlock and fasten it to the trail as well.
€6 (€1 train ride, €5 entrance fee to Via Dell’Amore).<br/>
10:15am - meet at the Monterosso train station (train leaves at 10:30 arrives in Manarola at 10:45 and Riomaggiore at 1050).<br/>
11am - meet at the beginning of the trail in either Manarola or Riomaggiore and begin the walk.</p>
