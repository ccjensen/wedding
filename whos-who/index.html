Fortunately she loves to travel, and was lucky enough to find herself a foreigner who shares the same passion. Anne loves cooking for Christopher and spends most of her time coming up with new recipes for her website WaffleHearts.com, which are of course taste tested by Christopher. With a green thumb and a favorable climate, the dishes are always full of healthy, home-grown ingredients.

Therefore it surprised no one that as soon as he reached adulthood he spent the next ten years seeing different parts of the world. Currently Christopher is really enjoying the sunny California coast while working at Apple Inc, helping to develop all of those very secret devices. You know you have one.

My favorite childhood memories of Anne are visiting her in California over the summer when we were in high school and driving around in her old mustang convertible; bedazzling t-shirts with iron on prints and tacky glue at Anne&#8217;s grandma&#8217;s house; and swimming in my back yard late at night with bowls of frozen grapes floating around the pool&#8230;

                <span class="category">About: </span>Mike, big brother of the bride, is the Director of Marketing for the San Jose State Athletics department. Mike is lucky enough to have a job where he gets to watch sports all day, which happens to be one of his favorite past times. He lives in California with his wife Joanna, their dog, Roxy Hart Queen of the Dessert, (yes, that is her legal name) and their cat, Alley. One of their favorite spots in California is the Napa Valley with all its fantastic wineries, and they look forward to the chance to compare them to the Buranco wines.
