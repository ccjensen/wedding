Over the years, she has been my pen pal, my partner in crime, my best friend, and the sister I've always wanted. My favorite childhood memories of Anne are visiting her in California over the summer when we were in high school and driving around in her old mustang convertible; bedazzling t-shirts with iron on prints and tacky glue at Anne's grandma's house; and swimming in my back yard late at night with bowls of frozen grapes floating around the pool..."]

While not jetsetting around the country with work, Øyvind goes for rides on his proper motorbike nicknamed the Millenium Falcon or walks in the mountains with the two L's."]
