June 18, 2013 --- 10:15-12:00  
**Lovers Walk**  
This is a one-mile easy, paved walk along the famous Via Dell’Amore; a trail between the two southern most towns Riomaggiore and Manarola. It was created in the 1920s while making the way for the train line. Prior to this villagers from Riomaggiore and Manarola rarely married anyone from outside of their own town but this trail created a way for lovers from the two towns to meet in the middle and fall in love. Now it is a tradition to take a padlock with you and when you get to the half way point you and your lover write your initials on the padlock, attach it to the fence and throw the key into the water symbolizing that your love is sealed forever and can never be unlocked. To reenact this ritual Christopher will lead a group from Manarola at 11am and Anne will lead a group from Riomaggiore at 11am. We will meet in the middle and place our lock amongst the hundreds of others. You may join whichever group you like and everyone who wishes to is invited to bring a padlock and fasten it to the trail as well. 
€6 (€1 train ride, €5 entrance fee to Via Dell’Amore).  
10:15am - meet at the Monterosso train station (train leaves at 10:30 arrives in Manarola at 10:45 and Riomaggiore at 1050).  
11am - meet at the beginning of the trail in either Manarola or Riomaggiore and begin the walk.

June 20, 2013  
Relax and enjoy all the wonderful food and atmosphere that the towns of the Cinque Terre offer. We invite guests to venture out into the different towns and explore. The five towns are only a 10 minute train ride apart and trains run about every 15 minutes until midnight.  
If you are an early riser we recommend that you check out the Thursday Morning Market: Each Thursday morning, trucks pull into the old town and fill the public area by the beach with temporary stalls where you can buy items not otherwise available in this small town.
