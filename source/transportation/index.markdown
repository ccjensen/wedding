## Getting to Cinque Terre
No matter which airport you fly into you will have to either rent a car or take the train to Monterosso.

***  
We might be able to arrange a shuttle to pick people up at either Pisa or Genova airport and deliver them to Monterosso if you let us know early enough. The shuttle costs €300 and seats 7 people so if you can organize yourselves, let us know what time you would like to be picked up and at which airport and we will see if there are any shuttles available.  
Please be prepared to pay in cash upon drop off.  

## Getting around Cinque Terre
The 5 towns are very small, and only allow cars at the outskirts of the villages. The easiest way to get around is by train. The trains run constantly, and stop at each town every 10-15 minutes. They are very easy to hop on and off, and they only cost about €1. You can also get the ['Cinque Terre' card](http://www.cinqueterreonline.com/5terrecard.htm) which covers both the train and any of the hikes that cost money.
