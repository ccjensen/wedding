***  
We might be able to arrange a shuttle to pick people up at either Pisa or Genova airport and deliver them to Monterosso if you let us know early enough. The shuttle costs â‚¬300 and seats 7 people so if you can organize yourselves, let us know what time you would like to be picked up and at which airport and we will see if there are any shuttles available.  
Please be prepared to pay in cash upon drop off.
