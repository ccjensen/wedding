Gifts are not expected, your presence is the best gift we could ask for. However if you do wish to contribute a gift we are happy to accept. We are registered at:  
<a href="http://www.surlatable.com/registry/giftRegistryList.jsp?id=200339166084" target="_blank">Sur la Table</a>  
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/CRSRA3AJ4DRU" target="_blank">Amazon USA</a>  
We are also accepting monetary donations towards our honeymoon in Switzerland. More details to follow.  
***
We will be going on our honeymoon directly following the wedding so we will be unable to bring gifts home from Italy.  Please have gifts sent to our home in California:
