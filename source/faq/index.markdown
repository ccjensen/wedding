**When should I book accommodation by?**  
Now or as soon as possible. It's a very popular vacation destination for Italians, and the wedding is on an Italian holiday weekend. Also there are only a few hotels and B&B's in each town, so they will likely book up 6 months in advance. Please make sure to arrange accommodation before RSVP'ing. For suggestions of places, take a look at the 'Accommodations' section.  

**Where should I stay?**  
We suggest staying in the town of Monterosso, as close to the coast as possible. The trains stop running at midnight and the wedding will go on past that time for those who wish to stay, so if you are staying in a different town you will have to leave earlier so that you can get the last train back.  
Please see our 'Accommodations' page for suggestions.

**Should I bring gifts to the wedding?**  
Considering this is a destination wedding we aren't expecting many gifts, but should you wish to get one we would prefer if any gifts were sent directly to our home in California. Otherwise we will have to pay for shipping from Italy. We have picked registry shops that are able to ship directly to our home. In addition, we have provided instructions on how you can contribute to our honeymoon by helping pay for different activites for us to do.

**What dates should I stay in the Cinque Terre area?**  
Anne and Chris will be in town and are planning get togethers starting on Monday 17th June 2013. They plan to depart the morning of the 22nd. Feel free to come as early or stay as late as you wish in the area, and if you are an outdoorsy person who enjoys hiking then the 5 towns have lots of things to see.
