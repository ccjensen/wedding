    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hopefully most of you got the email we sent out last week in regards to speeches at the wedding, but here is a repeat for those who feel a need for it again :)
My brother, Steven, has agreed to be the Toastmaster at the wedding. Since we have a wedding planner taking care of most of the day, Steven&#8217;s toastmaster duties have been reduced to only include organizing the &#8220;guest contributed&#8221; meal entertainment. This means Steven is the person you should get in touch with if you wish to say a few words (a speech) at the wedding. The easiest way to get ahold of Steven is on his email address scjensen(a)gmail.com. Please make sure to let him know your relation to us if you get in touch with him.</p>
